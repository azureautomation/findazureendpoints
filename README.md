Find-AzureEndPoints
===================

            
Updted for Azure PowerShellVersion 0.7.1

This is a script to find configured Azure end-points on VMs (get-azureenpoint). It will report back any active VM with the port, protocol and name of any configured endpoint.
This script idea came from wanting to prevent portal users from opening endpoints in a subscription
 that has a company VPN and a configured VNET using private IP adderss.
 
Or in other words - audit anyone using Azure as an internet entry point instead of the corporate FW.
 

 
 

 

 

 


 

 


 




 



 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
